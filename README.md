Exploring properties of amino acids in immunoglobulin clonal lineages


Description: 
An antibody repertoire can be viewed as a collection of clonal lineages. Each clonal lineage presents a result of somatic hypermutagenesis and clonal selection and thus can be described as an evolutionary tree. The goal of this project is to analyze somatic hypermutations appearing in expanded clonal lineages and reveal associations between immunoglobulin positions and properties of amino acids generated through the mutation process.    

Goals:

(1) constructing evolutionary trees on various repertoire-sequencing datasets using IgEvolution tool;

(2) finding positions in immunoglobulins demonstrating strong selection for the certain trait of amino acid (hydrophobicity / size / charge / etc);

(3) designing an approach for estimating statistical significance of the results
